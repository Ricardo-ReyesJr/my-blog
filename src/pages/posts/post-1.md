Welcome to my _new blog_ about my journey learning to code. Here I will share my learning journey as I continue to learn programming and my path onto becoming a software engineer.

## What I've Accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: I am making my blog using Astro.
2. **Making Pages**: As I continue to learn to create and build my blog using Astro as a framework. I have created multiple pages.
3.  **Making Blog Posts**: Blog posts are created using _Markdown files_ .md extension.

## What's Next

I will continue to finish with Building the blog cleaning it and styling it. I will change the name, when the poll results come back with the best pick by everyone.
